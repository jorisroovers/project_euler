# The main insight for the solution to this problem is that each path that 
# reaches the bottom right corner has the following properties
# for grid size 2: [ 'D', 'R', 'D', 'R']
#   -> the length of each valid path is 4
#   -> in each path, there are 2 'D' movements, and 2 'R' movements
# for grid size n:
#   -> the length of each valid path is n*2
#   -> in each path, there are n 'D' movements, and n 'R' movements
# 
# So, what we are really looking for is what number of arrays of length n*2
# contain n 'D's and n 'R's.
# To generate a single such array, we randomly pick n positions for 'D' in 
# that array, and fill the positions that are not chosen with by 'R'.
# To determine how many such arrays we can generate, we fall back to a 
# basic combinatorial: choose n out of n*2 -> C(n, n*2)
# From math, we know that C(p, q) -> q!/(q-p)!p!

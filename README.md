Project Euler - Solutions
=========================
An attempt to solve the project Euler challenges.

Code for each problem is located in the according directory (package)
in a solution.py module.

To run the solution for a given problem:
```
python runner.py <problem nr> <problem args>

# Example
python runner.py 7 100
```

NOTE: Currently still in the progress of converting the solutions to using
runner.py. For some you might need to run the directly:
```
cd problemx
python solution.py
```

Not working
-----------
The following solutions are known to be incorrect:
- problem8

Incomplete
----------
The following solutions are still work in progress
- problem11
- problem12
